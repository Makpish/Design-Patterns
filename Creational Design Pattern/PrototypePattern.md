#Prototype Pattern
##https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/prototype-pattern/


- Using the prototype pattern, you do not create a new object for each client requesting the object. Instead, you start by creating a single object, called a prototype and make copies of it for each client requesting the object.

- If a large number of such objects needs to be created, you can avoid repeating those steps for each object by initially creating a prototype and then making copies of it.
