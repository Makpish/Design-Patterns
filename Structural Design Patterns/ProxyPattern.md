#Proxy Pattern
##https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/proxy-pattern/


- Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

- The Proxy pattern uses a proxy (surrogate) object “in place of” another object. The objective of a proxy object is to control the creation of and access to the real object it represents. A common use of a proxy is to defer the cost of instantiating of an object (that is expensive to create) until it is actually needed by clients.
