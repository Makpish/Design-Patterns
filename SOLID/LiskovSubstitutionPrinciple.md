#Liskov Substitution Principle
##https://springframework.guru/principles-of-object-oriented-design/liskov-substitution-principle/


- Liskov Substitution Principle states the following: “in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.)”. Simply said, any object of some class in an object-oriented program can be replaced by an object of a child class. In order to understand this principle better, we’ll make a small digression to briefly remind ourselves about the concept of inheritance and its properties, as well as subtyping, a form of polymorphism.
