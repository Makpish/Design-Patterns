#Single Responsibility Principle
##https://springframework.guru/principles-of-object-oriented-design/single-responsibility-principle/


- The single responsibility principle revolves around the claim that a certain code module (most often, a class) should only have responsibility over one part of the functionality provided by the software. In software engineering books, this is sometimes also defined like this: the module should only have one reason to change. This means that a division of concerns is performed in the program, and the methods for every concern should be completely encapsulated by a single class. Now it is obvious that this approach contributes to the high cohesion – since methods related to the same concern (same part of the functionality) will be members of the same class, and robustness – since this reduces the possibility of error. Furthermore, if an error does occur, the programmer will be more likely to find the cause, and finally, solve the problem.
