#Command Pattern
##https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/command-pattern/


- Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

- The Command Pattern is a proven solution that addresses such recurring problems of tightly coupled invoker and receiver components in applications. This pattern states that requests should be encapsulated as objects that like any other objects can be stored and passed around the application. Requests encapsulated as objects are known as commands.
