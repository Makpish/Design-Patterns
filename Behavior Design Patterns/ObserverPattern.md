#Observer Pattern
##https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/observer-pattern/


- Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- The Observer Pattern facilitates communication between decoupled objects. It defines relationship between objects â€“ usually a single subject having a one-to-many relationship with multiple observers so that when the state of the subject changes, all its observers are notified accordingly.
