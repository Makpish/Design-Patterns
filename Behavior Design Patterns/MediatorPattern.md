#Mediator Pattern
##https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/mediator-pattern/


- Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

- The Mediator pattern says that instead of allowing a set of objects to directly interact between them, define an object (mediator) that will handle the interactions. What the mediator essentially says to such set of objects is “talk with me instead of talking among yourselves”. This figure conceptually shows how objects interact without and with a mediator.
